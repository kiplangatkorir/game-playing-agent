# Tic-Tac-Toe Q-Learning Agent

## Introduction

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play Tic-Tac-Toe using the Q-learning algorithm. The agent learns to play against a random opponent by exploring the game state space and updating its knowledge based on the rewards received.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tictactoe-rl-agent.git
cd tictactoe-rl-agent
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
